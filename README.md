# AI-Based Scanning Solution for Accurate Mail Delivery

## Overview

The AI-Based Scanning Solution aims to address the issue of incorrect or mismatched addresses in India's vast postal network. With over 165,000 post offices and nearly 19,000 pin codes, ensuring accurate mail delivery can be challenging. This solution leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to identify the correct Delivery Post Office for mail items with unclear or mismatched addresses. It also integrates with internal operational databases to align with dynamic postal operations and optimize delivery processes.

## Key Features

- **Address Analysis**: Utilizes machine learning to analyze and interpret address information, determining the appropriate Delivery Post Office.
- **Dynamic Pincode Mapping**: Aligns with internal operational databases to handle merged pin codes and evolving delivery network configurations.
- **Automated Identification**: Improves last-mile delivery efficiency by automating the identification process, reducing delays, and enhancing customer satisfaction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-postal-scanning-solution.git
   cd ai-postal-scanning-solution
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**
   - Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
   - Create a virtual environment and activate it:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configuration**
   - Edit the `config.yaml` file to include your API keys and database connection details.

2. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **API Endpoints**
   - `/scan`: POST endpoint to submit mail items for address analysis.
     - Request Body: JSON containing mail item details.
     - Response: JSON with the suggested Delivery Post Office and pincode.

## Data

- **Training Data**: Description of datasets used for training the machine learning model.
- **Internal Database**: Information on how the system integrates with and updates internal postal databases
